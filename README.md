# spynet_jammer
SPYNET is a Python tool for educational and ethical hacking. It simulates WiFi jamming by sending deauthentication packets to disconnect devices from a WiFi network. The tool scans for nearby networks, identifies connected devices, and disrupts communication between devices and access points (APs).
